## Introduction

Our team has noticed that when looking for a used vehicle, there are multiple platforms that host second-hand car ads. 
As such, it can get tedious looking through all of them to find what is needed. Furthermore, you would have to register for 3 different services
to get updates about new listing and such. 
We decided to make a tool that scrapes the 3 main platforms: Autogitas.lt, Autoplius.lt, and lt.brcauto.eu.
Then, all 3 platforms will be checked at a desired interval for new listings.
