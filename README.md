## Introduction

Our team has noticed that when looking for a used vehicle, there are multiple platforms that host second-hand car ads. 
As such, it can get tedious looking through all of them to find what is needed. Furthermore, you would have to register for 3 different services
to get updates about new listing and such. 
We decided to make a tool that scrapes the 3 main platforms: Autogitas.lt, Autoplius.lt, and lt.brcauto.eu.
Then, all 3 platforms will be checked at a desired interval for new listings. 


## Component overview

### Graphical User Interface
In the initial stages of development, our team deliberated between Tkinter and Kivy for the project's graphical user interface (GUI). Kivy was ultimately chosen due to its cross-platform compatibility, ensuring accessibility on common operating systems like macOS and Windows. Building the GUI involved learning Kivy Language, a new language specifically designed for constructing app layouts within the Kivy framework.  While limited resources and the complexity of Kivy's documentation presented initial challenges, our team persevered, leveraging online resources to gain a comprehensive understanding of the language. By project completion, we had successfully navigated these hurdles and established a solid grasp of Kivy Language's functionalities.
